CAIS is an open-source scripting language made for system management, hibrid application development, wrappers, and script development; that runs on top of Java's and Python's VMs.

CAIS is aimed to be a fast, easy and powerful scripting language. It stands out for its easy compilation in all architectures, as it is not compiled to a specific architecture, but to Java's and Python's bytecode.
